## setup

keep aws secrets in `secrets.txt` just for reference, you need to put them in travis web ui. and for the love of god don't expose the secrets on github

## how to build

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/daniellizik/template-translator
$ cd template-translator
$ npm i
$ npm run dev
# will be running at localhost:8080/dev
```

## production

## staging

todo: typically you would use a vpn with staging...? vpc?
